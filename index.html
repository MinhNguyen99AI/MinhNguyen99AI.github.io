		<img src="assist.png" class = "img-fluid mb-3">
		<p>Inspired by Jarvis in Iron Man, this is an implementation in our real world. This virtual assistant function the same way as Google's Alexa, or Apple's Siri. One up side is that: it is more personallized to me. </p>
		<p>Functions included: send email, play a song, open an app, close an app, perform Google Search, check weather at the current location, check weather at a specific location, check movies ratings, look up wikipedia, define English words, set alarm.</p>

		<h5> 4. GAN Images Detector </h5>
		<img src="gan.png" class = "img-fluid">
		<p class = "mt-3">  GANs has quickly became popular in the last several years. But GAN's uses for the goods is as huge as it is for the bads. We re-implemented several GAN-based method that helps us detect synthetic images.  </p>
		
		<img src="gan2.png" class = "img-fluid">
		<p> Table explanation: On the left are the datasets that are tested on. On the top are the names of methods we tried.</p>
		<p>Our experiment shows that, although most of the methods perform quite well on fake images that similar to what have been seen, those that were not seen can easily trick all detectors.  </p>

	<h2 class = "text-center"> Q&A</h2>
		<div class = "container mb-5 mt-5">
			<h4 class = "mb-4"> Why did I decide to go into AI? </h4>
			<p>Most of technology related topics get me excited. That is why I decided to go into Computer Science. In among all the fields of Computer Science, AI makes me excited the most.</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "container mb-5 mt-5">
			<h4 class = "mb-4"> Why do I want to work in New York? </h4>
			<p>Not just that I want to work in New York, but I <strong>only </strong> want to work in New York. My girlfriend got admitted to Columbia in April, and she is coming to New York. I want to be with her. Being here alone since 17 without my family has taught me how important it is to fight for our love ones.</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "container mb-5 mt-5">
			<h4 class = "mb-4"> Do I have any working experience with AI/ML? </h4>
			<p>Unfortunately I have not had the opportunity to have working experience in AI/ML. I am more than happy to take an intern position (if available) if I do not seem like a good fit due to lack of experience.</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "container mb-5 mt-5">
			<h4 class = "mb-4"> Am I legally allowed to work? </h4>
			<p> Yes, I am. I have sent my OPT application to the ISCIS on May 20th. I should receive my EAD card within 4-6 weeks. My OPT start date is July 20th, 2022. I have 36 months of post-completion OPT</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "container mb-5 mt-5">
			<h4 class = "mb-4">Do I need Visa sponsorship in the future?</h4>
			<p> No, I do not.</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "container mb-5 mt-5">
			<h4 class = "mb-4"> Is my AI Master Program at Boston only a 9 months program? </h4>
			<p>It is a 3 semesters program, but I rushed the program and completed in 2 semesters. </p>
		</div>

		<div class = "container mb-5 mt-5">
			<h4 class = "mb-4"> Why Am I a good fit for your organization? </h4>
			<p>If you enjoy helping and bringing happiness to others, then we now have one thing in common. <3 :) </p>
			<p>I am not afraid to fail. Failures lead to success. </p>
			<p>I understand that I might not know everything that is required for the job. But I can learn, and overcome.</p>
			<p>I am very loyal, and I put my heart and sweat in my work.  </p>
			<p>Life is hard, but that is fine. I will keep on going, and I will help others to keep on going too. There are countless of hardships out there, waiting for me to face them. But I am ready.</p>
			<p> All I need now is for you to give me a chance! I would be grateful! Thank you! </p>
